# Endlessly
Here is the game's Assets file, essentially everything I've worked on for it. GitHub doesn't allow me to upload all the files here.

In this game, you control a circle and must dodge hexagons while listening to dynamic background music that changes based on the game's stage and hexagon spawning patterns. The game is an endless adventure, where you conquer through the various gradient hexagons and ever-changing background colors. Your goal is to play endlessly and enjoy till you break your monitor
